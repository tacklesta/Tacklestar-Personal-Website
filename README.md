# Tarun-Personal-Website
 This is my portfolio website, which I tried making completely from scratch with ReactJS as base.

## Description

The template is taken as a reference from [Tim Baker](https://github.com/tbakerx) , so thanks to him.

I changed some of the react components and their functionality according to my need and made required modifications and adjustment for the responsiveness of the website.
